		<!-- Kipo's History -->
		<h3>I'm a Mega Jaguar?! How did that happen?!</h3>
		<p>It all started when my super-cool super-smart parents experimented on me before I was born. They're scientists from a burrow of scientists (that's what we called our underground homes, by the way&#8212;burrows) who were try to find a way to demute-ify the surface world. Their boss, Emelia, did <i>not</i> like mutes (mutants, you know, like talking animals, giant animals, animals with extra eyes or legs) and wanted to use their research to take away their mute abilities. She was <i>awful</i>. But thankfully, my parents were able to see how wrong she was&#8212;through me.</p>

		<!-- Powers -->
		<h4>My Mega Powers</h4>
		<ul id="powers">
			<li>Super hearing!</li>
			<li>Night vision!</li>
			<li>Super strength!</li>
			<li>Super smell! (This one can get pretty gross.)</li>
			<li>Did I mention I turn into a 100ft tall jaguar? And I grow, like, six legs and a bunch of tails. I know, it's pretty cool.</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Friends -->

		<h2>So how did we end up here?</h2>
		<p>If you've gotten this far, I'm betting your not from around here. You might be thinking, "Talking animals? A girl who can turn into a jaguar? That's ridiculous! How am I supposed to believe that crazy story?" It totally is a crazy story, but it's true. And long. One that I've taken the liberty of explaining in excruciating detail (Wolf's words, not mine).<br><br>
			It's a story with twists and turns. Friendships and betrayals. Love and war. (Have I hooked you yet?) You should totally <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80221553">check it out from the beginning</a>. I promise you'll be glad you did!</p>
